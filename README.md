# Servlets_JSP
This repo contains the lab from the servlets/jsp lesson as we all another project in which I created.  This project takes lessons from this section and applies them to create a MadLibs program utilizing TomCat, Maven, Servlets, and JSP.  Users enter a name, then an adverb, then a noun, and finally, an adjective.  A madlibs style reponse is returned to the user.
